I am currently enrolled in the *Committee on International Relations* program.
I recently moved to Chicago from Mohyliv-Podilskyi, Ukraine, where I taught English. If you want more information about Mohyliv-Podilskyi, I suggest you visit the [link to the Mohyliv-Podilskyi Wikipedia page!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohyliv-Podilskyi)

I currently work for a company called Ringle, which provides online English tutoring for advanced-level English speaking Koreans. 

### Past times

*Exploring new places ( cities, parks, museums, countries )
*Practicing/learning new languages
*Cooking
*Hanging out with friends ( when we were able to do that :sobs: )
Spending time with family

That is about it for me. Hopefully I did this assignment correctly :joy:
